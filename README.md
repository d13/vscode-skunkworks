# D13 Skunkworks

> **WARNING**: This is purely a testbed for trying out ideas for VS Code Extensions and should be considered experimental.

This is the README for your extension "skunkworks". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
- `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something.
